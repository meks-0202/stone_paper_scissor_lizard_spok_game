# stone_paper_scissor_lizard_spok

A game created by Sam Kass , a extended version of stone paper scissor. When you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well,so this is a slight variation that reduces that probability. 

This game got it's popularity from the show "The big bang theory". 

As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

here is a python version by me
